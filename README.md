# PassGen

a boring password generator for myself.  
it loads. it works. that's all.

## why

because "some" generators take 10 seconds to load.  
this one is **much** faster
it's one html file.  
there is no build system. no analytics. no js frameworks.  
no cookie banners. no fingerprinting. no requests.

just characters on a screen.  
like it used to be.

---

## what it does

- random password, generated instantly
- browser-native crypto
- configurable character set
- runs entirely client-side
- works offline

---

## how to use

open the page.  
copy the password.  
or download `passgen.html` and keep it forever.
